# Mission files

The DayZ Expansion mod contains a ready-to-use mission file that house all necessary central economy files. The mission comes in two variants; ChernarusPlus and ChernarusPlusGloom. If you want to use visual tweaks of DayZ Expansion such as; custom ocean, lighting tweaks, etc then you have to use ChernarusPlusGloom mission file (Providing that you are using Chernarus as your map, support for other maps can be added by creators of maps themselves or by us later throughout the mod updates). If you proceed with ChernarusPlusGloom mission file its important to set lightingConfig inside your server config file to 2.

# Server config

After starting your server with the DayZ Expansion mod for the first time, the server will generate the ExpansionMod folder in your profiles folder, in that folder all DayZ Expansion related settings and storage will be stored, if you want to toggle any part of DayZ Expansion proceeded into settings folder and open specific file you want to tweak. An overview of all the settings and what they do can be found [here](https://github.com/salutesh/DayZ-Expansion-Scripts/wiki/Server-settings)
