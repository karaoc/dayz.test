## Creating a Territory

To create a territory you need to craft a flag. The recipe is 1 stick and 1 rag !

Once crafted, deploy the flag where you want your territory to be and interact with the flag to create the territory.

## How do a Territory work ?

From your book you can invite other survivors to your territory. By default they need to be near you but server hosters can disable this condition.

Any members of your territory (including you) will be able to build and dismantle inside your territory while outsider won't be able to. Meaning they will have to raid you if they want to get inside your base.

A territory is by default a perimeter of 150 meters but server hosters can tweak this value in the server settings.

Multiple settings can be tweaked or enabled/disabled to help server hosters follow their vision. Some servers will allow you to build and/or dismantle outside territories or will limit the amount of members per territories for example !
