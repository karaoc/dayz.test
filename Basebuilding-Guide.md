## Creating a Territory

To create a territory you need to craft a flag. The recipe is 1 **stick** and 1 **rag** !

Once crafted, deploy the flag where you want your territory to be and interact with the flag to create the territory.

## How do a Territory work ?

From your book you can invite other survivors to your territory. By default they need to be near you but server hosters can disable this condition.

Any members of your territory (including you) will be able to build and dismantle inside your territory while outsider won't be able to. Meaning they will have to raid you if they want to get inside your base.

A territory is by default a perimeter of 150 meters but server hosters can tweak this value in the server settings.

Multiple settings can be tweaked or enabled/disabled to help server hosters follow their vision. Some servers will allow you to build and/or dismantle outside territories or will limit the amount of members per territories for example !

## Crafting your BaseBuilding kits

To create your base you first need basebuilding kits ! All the recipes are 1 **stick** and 1 **rope** !

## Building your Base

You will need **planks**, **nails** and **lumber**. **Lumber** can be crafted from logs sawed by a **hacksaw** or a **handsaw**.

Most kits have multiple uses, for example the wall kit can become a wall, window, door, gate. You will get the option after building the frame of the base building element as show in the videos.

To build you can use a hatchet or a hammer.

If you want to disable/enable snapping Press **X**

You can also attach codelocks to doors and gates. By default they are 4 digits but can be changed by server hosters. You can tell how many digits the codelock is by the message "PIN CODES(X)" x being the number of digits.

## Dismantling your Base

To dismantle, you need to be on the soft side and use a **crowbar** or a **hatchet**. You need to look at the part to get the option to dismantle as shown in the video.

## How do raiding a base work ?

I'm away for a couple of weeks so instead of a nice tutorial here is a tldr :

Explosives and projectiles (bullets) can damage basebuilding elements and safes. This can be tweaked or even disabled by server hosters.
