## Car Keys

### How does it work ?

have the car keys in your hands and go to your car and now you should have the option.

However server hosters can tweak it's behavior : 

    "VehicleRequireKeyToStart": 1,
    "VehicleRequireAllDoors": 1,
    "VehicleLockedAllowInventoryAccess": 0,
    "VehicleLockedAllowInventoryAccessWithoutDoors": 1,

## Towing

### What are the requirements to have the option to tow a vehicle ?

#### A car can tow another car

- The car should not be locked
- The car should not be already be towed or towing another car

#### A Helicopter can tow any types of vehicles

- The vehicle should not be locked
- The vehicle should not be already be towed or towing another vehicle
- The vehicle you are trying to tow should have nobody onboard

### How does it work ?

While in the driver seat of your vehicle, look at the vehicle you want to tow. If all the conditions listed above are correct, you will get the option to "Tow" the vehicle with [F] (you will see the prompt on the bottom left corner of your screen).

To Untow the vehicle, the action will also be with [F] and you will maybe need to use scrollwheel to see the action.

## Horn

A car require his **battery** to allow the player to use the Horn. While on the driver seat, **Hold [H] to use the Horn**.

Skins can also have a custom Horn if configured. More will be shared when this system will be ready to be deployed...
